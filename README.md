This is the Persian translation of Clipgrab video downloading software that is available in the last release.

# Timeline
## <string>Tue, Jan 5, 2016</strong>
This was the first time that I sent an email to the website support support@clipgrab.org to make him sure that I'm ready to start translating and he said to me that he is working on the technical problems to make the software ready for RTL and new languages.

## <string>Wed, Feb 3, 2016</strong>
At this time, he sent me the <strong>clipgrab_fa.ts</strong> file to start translating.

## <string>Tue, May 9, 2017</strong>
After translating all words/sentences you can see in the file, I sent him back the translated file to the support email.

## <string>Wed, May 17, 2017</strong>
After about two weeks he sent me a reply and said he will put my file to the new release of software as "فارسی" in the setting menu.

# Conclusion
The last time I was contacting the support@clipgrab.org to update the translation file was <strong>Oct 14, 2020</strong>.
